        <h5>Labor Force Survey, Kosovo 2017</h5>
        <img src="assets/img/new2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>IDRA Kosova is working together with Social Impact to conduct Labor Force Survey in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>In December 2015, the Millennium Challenge Cooperation (MCC), an independent U.S.
          foreign aid agency, that is helping to lead the fight against global poverty,
          has selected <b>Kosovo as eligible</b> for its <b>Millennium Threshold Program</b>.</p>
        <p>The Threshold Program assists and supports governments’ efforts in developing and
          reforming policies and institutions in furtherance of economic growth. In order to
          successfully implement the program, the selected country must demonstrate commitment to
          just and democratic governance, investments in its people and economic freedom as measured
          by different policy indicators.</p>
        <p>With the aim of facilitating reliable economic analysis and enhance the process of
          becoming eligible for implementation, Social Impact (SI) has been contracted by MCC to
          conduct a nationally and regionally representative labor force and time use study in Kosovo.</p>
        <p><b>The key objective</b> of this research is to explore the dynamics around employment and
          time use in Kosovo with special attention to impacts on labor market decisions, factors that
          inhibit entrepreneurship and gender related issues. The main goal is to identify binding
          constraints to growth.</p>
        <p><b>IDRA</b>, acting as a sub-contractor, is responsible for the <b>data collection</b> and <b>quality
           assurance</b> thereof. The data is collected over a period of 5 months, from February to June 2017,
           through three primary activities;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Household Rosters on Labor Force Status</li>
            <li>Extended Interviews</li>
            <li>Time Use Surveys</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The data collection is conducted in 854 Enumeration Areas (EAs) evenly distributed
           across the seven regions of Kosovo. 10 households per EA will be enumerated resulting
            in a <b>total sample size of 8,540</b>.</p>
